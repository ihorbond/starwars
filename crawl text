Long time ago there was a traveler from a galaxy called "Ukraine" who has always been interested in technology. 

He flew 2000 miles away from his home to this new world called 'America'. He traveled all over the world in search of a web development path and finally arrived to Florida, where discovered the Ironhack Force Camp. Rumor has it, that Obi Wan Nizaroni trained the traveler to become a Full-Stack JavaScript Jedi. 

The outcome of that training is reflected in this game you are about to play. May the force be with you.
